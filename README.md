# TinyLetter Archive to HTML converter

Requires csv and to_slug Ruby gems.

`gem install csv`
`gem install to_slug`

I made this to help convert my friend [Max Grinnell](https://theurbanologist.com)'s TinyLetter archives to HTML for use elsewhere.

Hopefully useful for someone else. I include the first of Max's newsletters as an example file. Please follow him on Patreon for further musings. <https://patreon.com/theurbanologist>

Enjoy.
